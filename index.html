      <p id="textPoem">Hello my beautiful girl!<br>
        It's been 5 months together and I still can't believe that we're together. You've given me a new breath of life, you've helped me remember who I am, you've given me the space where I can be safe, you've given me the peace and security that I never thought I'd really have.
        You've been the most beautiful gift that life has given me. I hope to share this and many more anniversaries with you, until eternity if possible, please, being in your heart is the most beautiful feeling I've ever felt.
        Happy anniversary, my dear Eman,
        Your future husband, Adrian, loves you. <br>
